You're struggling with credentials and tenant setup for branch protection.
Good news: GitHub CLI handles all that! No manual UI navigation needed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Authenticate with GitHub (One Time Setup)

    cd /workspaces/edumind-ai
    gh auth login

Then just follow the prompts:
  • Pick "GitHub.com"
  • Pick "HTTPS"
  • Say "Yes" to authenticate Git
  • Pick "Login with a web browser"
  • Copy the code shown
  • Press Enter (opens browser)
  • Paste code in browser
  • Click "Authorize"

STEP 2: Configure Branch Protection (One Command)

    ./deployment/scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh

That's it! The script will:
  ✅ Verify you're authenticated
  ✅ Check you have admin access
  ✅ Apply all branch protection rules
  ✅ Validate configuration

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 EVEN EASIER: INTERACTIVE GUIDED SETUP

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Run this ONE command instead:

    ./deployment/scripts/easy-setup.sh

It will guide you through BOTH authentication AND configuration!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN THIS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The 'main' branch will be protected with:

  ✓ Require Pull Request with 1 approval
  ✓ Require all CI/CD checks to pass
    - build-and-test
    - code-quality
    - build-matrix (3 platforms)
  ✓ Integration tests run on EVERY PR
  ✓ Require conversation resolution
  ✓ Block force pushes
  ✓ Block branch deletion
  ✓ Enforce for administrators

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 VERIFY IT WORKED

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Quick check:

    gh api repos/johnazariah/edumind-ai/branches/main/protection

Or view in browser:

    https://github.com/johnazariah/edumind-ai/settings/branches

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❓ TROUBLESHOOTING

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"You do not have admin access"
  → Ask repo owner (johnazariah) to run the script
  → Or ask for admin permissions

"gh: command not found"
  → Already installed in your dev container!
  → Verify: gh --version

"Authentication failed"
  → Try browser auth: gh auth login
  → Or use Personal Access Token (see docs)

🎯 BOTTOM LINE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Instead of fighting with:
  ✗ Manual tenant configuration
  ✗ Credential setup in UI
  ✗ Navigating GitHub settings

Just run these 2 commands:

    gh auth login
    ./deployment/scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh

Or even easier, just run:

    ./deployment/scripts/easy-setup.sh

That's literally all you need! 🎉
