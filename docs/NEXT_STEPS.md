## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **LLM Costs** - Need to implement aggressive caching
2. **Scale** - Need load testing before 1000 student launch
3. **FERPA Compliance** - Requires legal review of data handling
4. **Real-time Performance** - SignalR at scale needs testing

### Mitigation Strategies

- Implement Redis caching for LLM responses
- Create load testing suite with K6 or JMeter
- Conduct security audit with external firm
- Performance test SignalR with 1000+ concurrent connections

---

## Conclusion

**Current State**: Strong foundation with complete domain layer, infrastructure, and analytics service.

**Immediate Priority**: Build Web API layer to expose existing functionality.

**Timeline to MVP**:

- **4 weeks** - Functional API + real-time features
- **8 weeks** - Add AI agents + student interface  
- **12 weeks** - Complete system with teacher interface
- **16 weeks** - All administrative interfaces

**Next Action**: Start with `StudentAnalyticsController` to expose the completed analytics service via REST API.
