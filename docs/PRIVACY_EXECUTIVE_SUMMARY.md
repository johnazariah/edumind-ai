# Privacy and Multi-Tenancy: Executive Summary

## Overview

This document provides an executive summary of EduMind.AI's privacy-first, multi-tenant architecture designed to protect student data while enabling effective educational assessment across multiple schools.

---

## Core Privacy Principle

### "Student data is sacred and must be protected at all costs."

This principle guides every architectural decision in EduMind.AI. We recognize that educational data is among the most sensitive information about a person, especially for minors, and implement **defense-in-depth** strategies to ensure absolute protection.

---

## Physical Database Partitioning Strategy

### One Database Per School

Unlike traditional multi-tenant SaaS applications that use row-level security within a shared database, EduMind.AI implements **physical database partitioning** where each school has its own dedicated database instance.

```
Traditional Multi-Tenant (Shared DB):          EduMind.AI (Isolated DBs):
┌─────────────────────────────┐              ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│    Single Database          │              │ School 1 │ │ School 2 │ │ School 3 │
│  ┌──────────────────────┐   │              │   DB     │ │   DB     │ │   DB     │
│  │ Students (All Schools)│   │              │          │ │          │ │          │
│  │ • SchoolId filter    │   │              │ Students │ │ Students │ │ Students │
│  │ • Risk of leaking    │   │              │ Classes  │ │ Classes  │ │ Classes  │
│  └──────────────────────┘   │              │ Teachers │ │ Teachers │ │ Teachers │
│                              │              │          │ │          │ │          │
│  ❌ Cross-school queries     │              │ ISOLATED │ │ ISOLATED │ │ ISOLATED │
│     possible with bugs       │              └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
└─────────────────────────────┘              
                                             ✅ Cross-school queries impossible
```

### Why Physical Partitioning?

1. **Impossible to Leak Data Across Schools**
   - No SQL query can accidentally access another school's data
   - Bug in filter logic cannot expose wrong students
   - SQL injection attacks isolated to single school
   - Network-level isolation between databases

2. **Regulatory Compliance Made Simple**
   - Each school's data is completely separate
   - Easy to export data for single school (GDPR data portability)
   - Simple to delete all data for a school (right to be forgotten)
   - Clear data custody and ownership

3. **Performance Isolation**
   - One school's heavy load doesn't impact others
   - School-specific performance tuning
   - Independent scaling decisions
   - Optimized indexes per school's usage patterns

4. **Security Audit Trail**
   - Per-school database access logs
   - Clear visibility into who accessed which school
   - Easy to detect unauthorized cross-school access attempts
   - Separate encryption keys per school possible

5. **Disaster Recovery**
   - School-specific backup schedules
   - Granular restore capabilities (restore one school without affecting others)
   - School-level failover
   - No risk of data mixing during recovery

### Trade-offs

**Costs:**
- Slightly more infrastructure overhead per school
- More complex connection string management
- Onboarding takes longer (database provisioning)

**Benefits:**
- **Absolute data isolation** (worth the overhead)
- Peace of mind for schools and parents
- Simplified compliance and auditing
- Better performance isolation

**Decision:** The privacy and security benefits far outweigh the operational costs.

## Privacy-Preserving Aggregate Reporting

### The Challenge

Teachers and administrators need aggregate information to identify areas of improvement:
- "What topics is the class struggling with?"
- "Which learning objectives need more focus?"
- "How does this class compare to others?"

**BUT:** We cannot reveal individual student performance in these aggregates.

### The Solution: K-Anonymity and Differential Privacy

#### Minimum Aggregation Threshold

**Rule:** Reports are only generated if **at least 5 students** are in the group.

```csharp
public const int MinimumAggregationThreshold = 5;

// Example: Class Performance Report
if (studentCount < 5)
{
    // Suppress entire report
    return new Report
    {
        IsDataSuppressed = true,
        SuppressionReason = "Insufficient students (3) for privacy-preserving aggregation. Minimum required: 5"
    };
}
```

#### Why 5 Students?

- With fewer than 5, individual students can be identified
- Example: If class has 3 students and average is 80%, seeing two students' scores allows deducing the third
- Industry standard for k-anonymity in educational data

#### Complementary Suppression

**Problem:** If 9 out of 10 students' data is shown, the 10th can be deduced.

**Solution:** Suppress small subgroups in distributions.

```csharp
// Example: Mastery level distribution
Original:
- Mastered: 1 student    ← Identifiable!
- Proficient: 8 students
- Developing: 1 student  ← Identifiable!

After Complementary Suppression:
- Proficient: 8 students
- Other: 2 students      ← Small groups combined
```

#### Differential Privacy for Large Groups

For classes with 20+ students, we add small random noise to prevent exact counting:

```csharp
public static int? PrivacyPreservingCount(this IEnumerable<object> items)
{
    var count = items.Count();
    
    if (count < 5)
        return null; // Suppress
    
    if (count >= 20)
    {
        var noise = Random.Shared.Next(-1, 2); // -1, 0, or 1
        return count + noise;
    }
    
    return count; // 5-19: exact count
}
```

**Effect:** Prevents exact student identification while maintaining report utility.

---

## Anonymized Reporting for Course Administrators

### The Challenge

Course administrators (curriculum designers) need to see how their content performs across schools to improve question quality and difficulty calibration.

**BUT:** They should **never** see individual student names or personally identifiable information.

### The Solution: Anonymized Aggregates Only

Course administrators have access to:

✅ **Allowed:**
- Question performance statistics (% correct, average time)
- Difficulty calibration data (aggregated across schools)
- Learning objective mastery trends (anonymized)
- Cross-school performance comparisons (no school names)

❌ **Forbidden:**
- Student names or IDs
- Individual student responses
- School names or locations
- Class names or teacher names

### Implementation

```csharp
public record QuestionPerformanceReport
{
    // Aggregated across ALL schools
    public required Guid QuestionId { get; init; }
    public int TotalAttempts { get; init; }        // Across all schools
    public double AverageCorrectRate { get; init; } // No school breakdown
    public double AverageTimeSeconds { get; init; }
    
    // Anonymized distribution
    public Dictionary<DifficultyLevel, int> PerceivedDifficultyDistribution { get; init; }
    
    // NO student PII, NO school identification
}
```

---

## Audit Logging for Compliance

### Comprehensive Access Trail

Every access to student data is logged with:

```csharp
public record DataAccessAuditLog
{
    public DateTimeOffset Timestamp { get; init; }
    public Guid UserId { get; init; }
    public string UserEmail { get; init; }
    public UserRole UserRole { get; init; }
    public Guid? SchoolId { get; init; }
    public string Action { get; init; }      // "VIEW", "EXPORT", "MODIFY", "DELETE"
    public string Resource { get; init; }    // "StudentAssessment", "StudentProfile"
    public Guid? ResourceId { get; init; }
    public string IpAddress { get; init; }
    public bool WasAuthorized { get; init; }
    public string? DenialReason { get; init; }
}
```

### FERPA Compliance

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) requires:
- ✅ Audit trail of all access to student records
- ✅ Ability to show parents who accessed their child's data
- ✅ Legitimate educational interest for all access
- ✅ No disclosure to third parties without consent

Our audit logging satisfies all FERPA requirements.

## Right to Be Forgotten (GDPR)

### Complete Data Deletion

When a student or parent requests data deletion:

```csharp
public async Task<Result<Unit>> DeleteStudentDataAsync(
    Guid studentId,
    string requestReason)
{
    // Physical partitioning makes this safe:
    // We're only touching the student's school database
    // Impossible to accidentally delete data from other schools
    
    await using var transaction = await _context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();
    
    // 1. Delete assessment responses
    await _context.StudentResponses
        .Where(sr => sr.StudentId == studentId)
        .ExecuteDeleteAsync();
    
    // 2. Delete assessments
    await _context.StudentAssessments
        .Where(sa => sa.StudentId == studentId)
        .ExecuteDeleteAsync();
    
    // 3. Delete progress tracking
    await _context.StudentProgress
        .Where(sp => sp.StudentId == studentId)
        .ExecuteDeleteAsync();
    
    // 4. Delete student profile
    await _context.Students
        .Where(s => s.Id == studentId)
        .ExecuteDeleteAsync();
    
    // 5. Log the deletion
    await LogDeletionAsync(studentId, requestReason);
    
    await transaction.CommitAsync();
}
```

**Safety:** Physical partitioning ensures we only touch the correct school's database.

## School Onboarding Process

### Intentionally Manual and Careful

Onboarding a new school is **intentionally not fully automated** to ensure proper data isolation is established.

### Process

1. **Business Administrator Creates School Metadata**
   - School name, district, contact information
   - Subscription tier and limits
   - Generate unique `SchoolId`

2. **Provision Dedicated Database**
   - Create new PostgreSQL database: `edumind_school_{schoolId}`
   - Set up database-level security policies
   - Create school-specific database role
   - Enable audit logging

3. **Run Database Migrations**
   - Apply schema to new school database
   - Create initial indexes
   - Set up row-level security policies (additional layer)

4. **Create School Administrator Account**
   - Generate initial admin user
   - Send welcome email with credentials
   - School admin can then add teachers

5. **Security Verification**
   - Test database isolation
   - Verify no cross-school queries possible
   - Run security audit
   - Store connection string in Azure Key Vault

6. **Activation**
   - Mark school as active
   - School can begin adding students and classes

**Time:** 30-60 minutes per school (mostly automated, but with manual verification steps)

**Benefit:** Ensures each school's data isolation is properly configured before activation.

## Data Flow Example

### Student Takes Assessment

```
1. Student logs in
   └─→ JWT token includes: { userId, role: "Student", schoolId: "abc-123" }

2. Middleware extracts tenant context
   └─→ TenantContext: { SchoolId: "abc-123", Role: "Student" }

3. Application resolves database connection
   └─→ SchoolDatabaseResolver looks up connection string for school "abc-123"
   └─→ Returns: "postgresql://...edumind_school_abc123..."

4. DbContext created for school's database
   └─→ DbContextFactory creates AcademicContext connected to school's DB
   └─→ Query filters automatically apply schoolId restrictions (belt + suspenders)

5. Student submits assessment
   └─→ Data saved to school's database ONLY
   └─→ Impossible to write to another school's database
   └─→ Audit log records access

6. Teacher views class results
   └─→ Same process: resolves to school's database
   └─→ Can only see classes in their school
   └─→ Aggregation thresholds enforced (minimum 5 students)
```

## Security Layers (Defense in Depth)

EduMind.AI implements multiple overlapping security layers:

### Layer 1: Physical Database Partitioning
- **Primary protection:** Each school has own database
- **Effect:** Cross-school data access physically impossible

### Layer 2: Connection String Resolution
- **Secondary protection:** Connection strings stored per school in Key Vault
- **Effect:** Application must know SchoolId to get connection string

### Layer 3: Tenant Context Middleware
- **Tertiary protection:** Every request tagged with SchoolId from JWT
- **Effect:** Application code always knows which school context

### Layer 4: EF Core Query Filters
- **Quaternary protection:** Database queries automatically filtered by SchoolId
- **Effect:** Even if bug in Layer 1-3, query filters prevent cross-school access

### Layer 5: Authorization Policies
- **Quinary protection:** Role-based access control enforced at API level
- **Effect:** Teachers can only access their assigned classes

### Layer 6: Audit Logging
- **Detection layer:** All data access logged immutably
- **Effect:** Any unauthorized access attempt detected and logged

**Result:** Multiple independent layers ensure student data cannot leak between schools.
