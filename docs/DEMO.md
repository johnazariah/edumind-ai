# EduMind.AI End-to-End Demo

This document provides a complete walkthrough of the EduMind.AI Academic Assessment Platform, demonstrating all features with realistic test data.

## Prerequisites

1. ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database running (`docker-compose up -d`)
2. ‚úÖ Database migrations applied
3. ‚úÖ Demo data seeded (`./scripts/seed-demo-data.sh`)
4. ‚úÖ API server running (`dotnet run --project src/AcademicAssessment.Web`)

## Demo Data Overview

The seed script creates a realistic academic environment:

### üè´ **3 Schools**

- **Lincoln High School** (Central District)
- **Washington Academy** (North District)  
- **Roosevelt Institute** (South District)

### üë• **31 Users**

- **1 System Administrator** - Full platform access
- **3 School Administrators** - One per school
- **6 Teachers** - Two per school (Math & Science)
- **24 Students** - Eight per school

### üìö **6 Courses**

- Mathematics: Algebra I, Algebra II, Pre-Calculus
- Physics: Physics I
- Chemistry: Chemistry I
- Biology: Biology I

### üìù **13 Assessment Templates**

- 183 total questions across all assessments
- Difficulty levels from 0 (Easy) to 4 (Very Hard)
- Multiple-choice questions with detailed learning objectives

### üìä **Student Performance Data**

- 80-100 student assessment attempts
- 1500+ student responses
- Realistic scores (60-95%)
- Time-stamped data over last 30 days

## Authentication

### Development Mode (Current)

Authentication is disabled in development. The API uses `TenantContextDevelopment` with stubbed user data.

```bash
# Test any endpoint without authentication
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/students/40000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001/analytics/performance-summary
```

### Production Mode (With Azure AD B2C)

Once Azure AD B2C is configured, authentication will be required. Use the test script:

```bash
# Acquire JWT token and test endpoints
./scripts/test-auth.sh
```

## Testing with JWT Authentication

Once Azure AD B2C is configured, use the test script:

### 1. Acquire Token

```bash
./scripts/test-auth.sh
```

Follow the prompts:

1. Opens browser for authentication
2. Login with Google account
3. Token is automatically captured
4. Token is saved to `.jwt_token` file

### 2. Test with Token

**Manual Testing:**

```bash
# Load token from file
TOKEN=$(cat .jwt_token)

# Test endpoint with authentication
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/students/40000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001/analytics/performance-summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "accept: application/json" | jq '.'
```

**Automated Testing:**

```bash
# test-auth.sh automatically tests 3 endpoints after acquiring token:
# 1. Performance Summary
# 2. Subject Performance (Mathematics)
# 3. Learning Objectives

# Run the script
./scripts/test-auth.sh
```

---

## Integration Test Demo

Run the comprehensive authentication test suite:

```bash
# Run all 45+ authentication/authorization tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~StudentAnalyticsControllerAuthTests"

# Run specific test categories
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~StudentAnalyticsControllerAuthTests.StudentCanAccessOwnData"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~StudentAnalyticsControllerAuthTests.TeacherCannotAccessStudentInDifferentSchool"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~StudentAnalyticsControllerAuthTests.SystemAdminCanAccessAnyStudent"
```

**Test Coverage:**

- ‚úÖ Authentication (401 without token)
- ‚úÖ Authorization (403 for unauthorized access)
- ‚úÖ All 7 endpoints protected
- ‚úÖ All 6 user roles tested
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant security validated

---

## Database Queries

Explore the data directly:

```bash
# Connect to database
docker exec -it edumind-postgres psql -U edumind_user -d edumind_dev

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Restart PostgreSQL
docker-compose restart postgres

# Check connection
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U edumind_user -d edumind_dev
```

### API Not Responding

```bash
# Check if API is running
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Check API logs
dotnet run --project src/AcademicAssessment.Web

# Restart API
# Ctrl+C to stop, then restart
```

### No Data Returned

```bash
# Verify demo data was seeded
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U edumind_user -d edumind_dev -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM academic.\"Students\";"

# Re-seed if needed
./scripts/seed-demo-data.sh
```

### Authentication Errors

```bash
# In development mode, authentication is disabled
# Check appsettings.Development.json:
# "Authentication": { "Enabled": false }

# For production testing, acquire fresh token:
./scripts/test-auth.sh
```
