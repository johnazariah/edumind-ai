## 🛡️ Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

1. **Week 1: Orchestrator Complexity** 🟢 MITIGATED
   - Risk: Algorithm design more complex than expected
   - Status: Successfully completed with comprehensive testing

2. **Week 2-3: UI Accessibility**
   - Risk: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance takes longer than planned
   - Mitigation: Use accessibility-first component libraries
   - Contingency: Phase 1 core functionality, Phase 2 full accessibility

3. **Week 4: Load Testing**
   - Risk: Performance issues require architecture changes
   - Mitigation: Early load testing in Week 2
   - Contingency: Azure SignalR Service, connection pooling tuning

4. **Week 5-6: Azure AD B2C**
   - Risk: Complex configuration delays deployment
   - Mitigation: Existing setup guide, allocate buffer time
   - Contingency: Use simpler JWT auth for pilot, upgrade later

### Mitigation Strategies

- ✅ Daily standups to identify blockers early
- ✅ Parallel work streams where possible
- ✅ Regular stakeholder updates
- ✅ Buffer time built into estimates
- ✅ Staging environment mirrors production
