**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/student-ui-week2`  
**Current Status:** Days 8-12 Complete (75%), Days 13-14 Remaining

---

## ✅ What We've Accomplished (Days 8-12)

### Assessment Dashboard & Navigation (Days 8-9) ✅

- AssessmentDashboard.razor with filtering and search
- AssessmentDetail.razor with metadata and learning objectives
- AssessmentNavigation.razor with breadcrumbs and progress

### Question Delivery Interface (Days 10-12) ✅

- QuestionRenderer with markdown, KaTeX math, and code highlighting
- Answer input components for all 9 question types
- QuestionPalette with status indicators
- AssessmentSession page with timer, autosave, and state management
- Session expiry handling with disabled UI states
- Local KaTeX and highlight.js assets

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Days 13-14)

### Priority 1: Complete Save/Submit Backend Integration

Currently, the UI has placeholder save/submit methods. We need to:

1. **Implement Save API Endpoint**
   - Create `POST /api/v1.0/Assessment/{assessmentId}/session/save`
   - Accept answer state (selected options, free responses, review flags)
   - Persist to database via `IStudentProgressRepository`
   - Return last saved timestamp

2. **Implement Submit API Endpoint**
   - Create `POST /api/v1.0/Assessment/{assessmentId}/session/submit`
   - Finalize assessment session
   - Trigger orchestrator for assessment analysis
   - Return session ID for results page

3. **Wire Up Frontend**
   - Update `SaveProgressAsync()` to call save endpoint
   - Update `SubmitAssessmentAsync()` to call submit endpoint
   - Add proper error handling and retry logic
   - Show toast notifications for save/submit success/failure

### Priority 2: Build Results Page (Task 2.9)

**File:** `src/AcademicAssessment.StudentApp/Components/Pages/AssessmentResults.razor`

**Features:**

- Overall score and percentage
- Subject-wise performance breakdown
- Time taken vs. estimated time
- Questions answered correctly/incorrectly/skipped
- Identify strong/weak areas
- "Review Answers" navigation to review mode
- Recommended next steps

**API Needed:**

- `GET /api/v1.0/Assessment/results/{sessionId}`
- Return: scores, breakdown, recommendations

### Priority 3: Progress Visualization (Task 2.8)

**Enhancement:** Add to existing AssessmentSession.razor

**Features:**

- More detailed progress metrics
- Subject-wise completion (if questions tagged by subject)
- Visual charts using Chart.js or similar
- Time efficiency indicator

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

Before merging to main, ensure:

1. **Manual Testing**
   - [ ] Complete an assessment end-to-end
   - [ ] Test timer expiry behavior
   - [ ] Verify autosave works correctly
   - [ ] Test all question types render properly
   - [ ] Verify KaTeX math rendering
   - [ ] Verify code syntax highlighting
   - [ ] Test question navigation and palette
   - [ ] Test mark for review functionality
   - [ ] Test session persistence across page refresh

2. **Unit Tests**
   - [ ] Component tests for QuestionRenderer
   - [ ] Component tests for answer inputs
   - [ ] Service tests for session state management

3. **Integration Tests**
   - [ ] API endpoint tests for session/save/submit
   - [ ] E2E test for complete assessment workflow

## 📝 Documentation Needs

1. **User Documentation**
   - How to take an assessment
   - Understanding the timer and autosave
   - Using the question palette
   - Reviewing answers

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Component architecture diagram
   - State management flow
   - API endpoints and contracts
   - Adding new question types

---

## 🎨 Optional Polish (If Time Permits)

1. **UX Enhancements**
   - Add loading skeletons instead of spinners
   - Smooth transitions between questions
   - Toast notifications for autosave
   - Confirm dialog before leaving assessment

2. **Accessibility**
   - Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
   - Test with screen reader

3. **Performance**
   - Lazy load question content
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Add service worker for offline support

---

## 🚀 Recommended Order of Work

### Phase 1: Backend Integration (4-6 hours)

1. Create save endpoint and wire up frontend
2. Create submit endpoint and wire up frontend
3. Test save/submit flow end-to-end

### Phase 2: Results Page (3-4 hours)

1. Create results DTO and API endpoint
2. Build AssessmentResults.razor component
3. Add navigation from session to results
4. Test results display

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish (2-3 hours)

1. Manual testing of complete workflow
2. Fix any bugs discovered
3. Add unit tests for critical components
4. Update documentation

### Phase 4: PR & Merge (1 hour)

1. Clean up code and comments
2. Update TASK_JOURNAL with final status
3. Create comprehensive PR description
4. Request review and merge

**Total Estimated Time:** 10-14 hours

## 🔮 Looking Ahead: Week 3 Preview

Once Week 2 is complete, Week 3 will focus on:

- **Accessibility features** (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- **Mobile responsiveness** (PWA features)
- **Performance optimization** (lazy loading, caching)
- **Error handling** (network resilience, graceful degradation)
- **Component testing** (>80% coverage)
- **E2E testing** (full user workflows)

This will take the assessment UI from "functional" to "production-ready."
