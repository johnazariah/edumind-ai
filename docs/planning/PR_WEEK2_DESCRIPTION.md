## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

- **Bootstrap 5**: Modern styling with cards, badges, progress bars
- **Bootstrap Icons**: Consistent iconography throughout
- **Gradient Accents**: Eye-catching score card with purple gradient
- **Color Coding**: Intuitive status colors (green=good, yellow=warning, red=danger)
- **Smooth Animations**: Toast slide-in, progress bar transitions
- **Loading States**: Spinners while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **Framework**: Blazor Server (.NET 9)
- **State Management**: Component-level with dictionary-based answer tracking
- **Thread Safety**: Semaphore locks for auto-save coordination
- **API Communication**: HttpClient with JSON serialization
- **Content Rendering**:
  - Markdig for Markdown → HTML
  - KaTeX for math equations
  - highlight.js for code syntax

### Key Design Patterns

- **Component Composition**: Modular components for reusability
- **Event Callbacks**: Parent-child communication (e.g., answer changes)
- **Disabled State Propagation**: Cascading disabled prop for expired sessions
- **Auto-save Pattern**: Background periodic saves with user-triggered saves
- **Navigation Flow**: Linear progression through workflow with breadcrumbs

### Performance Considerations

- **Auto-save Throttling**: Semaphore prevents concurrent saves
- **Local Asset Serving**: KaTeX and highlight.js from wwwroot (no CDN)
- **Lazy Content Rendering**: Only current question rendered
- **Efficient State Updates**: InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged) for async updates
