# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Repository Details
- **Repository Name**: edumind-ai
- **Description**: Academic Assessment Multi-Agent System - AI-powered personalized educational testing for 1000+ students across grades 8-12
- **Visibility**: Public (or Private, your choice)

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

You can create the repository in two ways:

### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
gh repo create edumind-ai --public --description "Academic Assessment Multi-Agent System - AI-powered personalized educational testing" --source=. --remote=origin
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `edumind-ai`
3. Description: `Academic Assessment Multi-Agent System - AI-powered personalized educational testing for 1000+ students`
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/edumind-ai.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

After pushing, verify on GitHub that you see:
- ✅ 2 commits
- ✅ 62 files
- ✅ README.md displayed on repository homepage
- ✅ All project folders (src/, tests/, docs/, deployment/)

## Optional: Add Repository Topics

On GitHub, add these topics to help others discover your project:
- `dotnet`
- `csharp`
- `education`
- `ai`
- `multi-agent-system`
- `assessment`
- `adaptive-learning`
- `machine-learning`
- `blazor`
- `signalr`
- `entity-framework-core`
- `azure-openai`

## Repository Settings Recommendations

### Branch Protection (Settings → Branches)
- Protect `main` branch
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass

### GitHub Actions (for CI/CD later)
- Enable Actions
- Set up .NET build workflow

### Issues and Projects
- Enable Issues for tracking
- Create Project board for task management
