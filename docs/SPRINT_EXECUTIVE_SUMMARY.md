## 🛡️ Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Week 1: Orchestrator Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Algorithm design more complex than expected
   - **Mitigation:** Daily code reviews, pair programming on core logic
   - **Contingency:** Simplify algorithm, iterate in future sprints

2. **Week 2-3: UI Accessibility**
   - **Risk:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance takes longer than planned
   - **Mitigation:** Use accessibility-first component libraries
   - **Contingency:** Phase 1: core functionality, Phase 2: full accessibility

3. **Week 4: Load Testing**
   - **Risk:** Performance issues require architecture changes
   - **Mitigation:** Early load testing in Week 2
   - **Contingency:** Azure SignalR Service, connection pooling tuning

4. **Week 5-6: Azure AD B2C**
   - **Risk:** Complex configuration delays deployment
   - **Mitigation:** Existing setup guide, allocate buffer time
   - **Contingency:** Use simpler JWT auth for pilot, upgrade later

### Dependencies
- **External:** Azure subscription, B2C tenant, SSL certificates
- **Internal:** Design assets, test data, stakeholder reviews
- **Technical:** Ollama model availability, .NET 9 stability
