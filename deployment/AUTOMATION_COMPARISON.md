- ~60-90 minutes of error-prone manual steps
- High risk of configuration mistakes
- Difficult to reproduce across environments
- No CI/CD automation

**After (Automated Process):**

- Single command: `./deployment/scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh dev`
- ~30-45 minutes (includes interactive Azure portal steps)
- Infrastructure as Code with Bicep

| Step | What You Had To Do | Time | Error Risk |
|------|-------------------|------|------------|
| **Part 1** | Manually create Google OAuth credentials | 15 min | High |
| **Part 2** | Manually create Azure AD B2C tenant | 10 min | Medium |

## 📋 Detailed Comparison

### **Part 1: Google OAuth Setup**

#### Before (Manual)

```
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
3. Enter project name manually
4. Wait for creation
5. Navigate to OAuth consent screen
6. Select "External" user type
7. Fill in App name, email, domains (easy to typo)
8. Add scopes one by one
9. Add test users (if needed)
10. Navigate to Credentials
11. Create OAuth client ID
12. Select "Web application"
13. Enter name
14. Add redirect URI (easy to get wrong)
15. Copy Client ID and Secret manually
16. Store somewhere (not secure)
```

#### After (Automated)

```bash
./deployment/scripts/setup-google-oauth.sh edumindai
```

Script:

- ✅ Guides you through each step
- ✅ Provides exact values to copy/paste
- ✅ Validates redirect URI format
- ✅ Securely stores credentials
- ✅ Adds to .gitignore automatically
- ✅ Shows B2C redirect URI (no guessing)

---

### **Part 2-6: Azure AD B2C Configuration**

#### Before (Manual)

```
Multiple Azure Portal pages:
- Create tenant (portal only)
- Switch directories
- Configure identity provider
- Create custom attributes
- Create user flow
- Configure claims
- Register application
- Create client secret
- Configure API permissions

Each step has 10-15 sub-steps
High risk of configuration mistakes
No validation of settings
No tracking of what's been done
```

#### After (Automated)

```bash
./deployment/scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh dev
```

Script:

- ✅ Guides you through each Azure portal step
- ✅ Shows exact values to use
- ✅ Waits for confirmation at each step
- ✅ Captures all IDs and secrets
- ✅ Stores everything in Key Vault
- ✅ Saves configuration file for reference
- ✅ No guessing or searching for values

---

### **Part 7: Azure Infrastructure**

#### Before (Manual)

```
NO AUTOMATION AT ALL

You had to manually:
- Create Azure resources via portal
- Configure App Service settings one by one
- Set up PostgreSQL and firewall rules
- Create Redis cache
- Configure Key Vault
- Set up Application Insights
- Connect everything together
- Manage connection strings
- Store secrets somewhere

Time: 2-3 hours
Risk: Very High
Repeatability: None
```

#### After (Automated)

```bicep
// deployment/bicep/main.bicep
// Complete infrastructure in ~200 lines

All resources deployed in ONE command:
- App Service Plan & Web App
- PostgreSQL Flexible Server
- Azure Cache for Redis
- Key Vault
- Application Insights
- Log Analytics
- Networking & Security
- Managed Identity
- RBAC permissions

Time: 10-15 minutes (Azure deployment)
Risk: Low (validated template)
Repeatability: 100%
```

---

### **Part 8: Configuration & Testing**

#### Before (Manual)

```
Update appsettings.json manually:
- Copy values one by one
- Easy to typo or miss a field
- No validation
- Secrets in plain text (risky)
- Have to remember what goes where
- Manual testing steps
- No automated health checks
```

#### After (Automated)

```bash
# Script automatically:
✅ Retrieves all values from Azure
✅ Stores secrets in Key Vault
✅ Configures App Service settings
✅ Runs database migrations
✅ Creates GitHub secrets for CI/CD
✅ Saves configuration file
✅ Performs health checks
✅ Validates deployment
```

---

### **CI/CD Pipeline**

#### Before (Manual)

```
NO CI/CD PIPELINE

Every deployment required:
- Manual build
- Manual test run
- Manual publish
- Manual upload to Azure
- Manual configuration
- Manual health check
- No automated testing
- No rollback plan
```

#### After (Automated)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-azure.yml

On every push to main:
✅ Automated build
✅ Run unit tests
✅ Run integration tests (with test DB)
✅ Publish artifacts
✅ Deploy to Azure
✅ Run database migrations
✅ Configure app settings
✅ Health checks
✅ Integration tests against deployed app
✅ Automatic rollback on failure

Manual triggers available for different environments
```
