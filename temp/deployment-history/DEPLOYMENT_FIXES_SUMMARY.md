# Deployment Pipeline Fixes Summary

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: Changes applied, awaiting manual commit/push

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ 6-Hour Timeout Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: The deployment workflow was timing out after exactly 6 hours.

**Root Cause**: The "Validate Aspire manifest" step was using `dotnet run` which actually started the entire Aspire AppHost and all services, causing it to hang indefinitely.

**Solution Applied**:

```yaml
- name: Generate Aspire manifest
  run: |
    echo "Generating Aspire manifest for validation..."
    dotnet publish src/EduMind.AppHost --configuration Release --no-build --output ./aspire-manifest
    echo "Manifest generated successfully"
  timeout-minutes: 5
```

**Result**: Build-and-test job now completes in ~46 seconds instead of timing out.

### 2. ✅ Azure Developer CLI Installation Failure (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Deployment failing with network error:

```
getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND azdrelease.azureedge.net
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND azdrelease.azureedge.net
```

**Root Cause**: The `Azure/setup-azd@v1.0.0` action was trying to download from `azdrelease.azureedge.net` which is unreachable.

**Solution Applied** (in 2 locations):

```yaml
- name: Install Azure Developer CLI
  run: |
    curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
    echo "$HOME/.azd/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

**Locations Fixed**:

1. Line ~80: In the `deploy` job
2. Line ~165: In the `integration-tests` job

**Result**: Uses Microsoft's official installer script via reliable aka.ms redirect service.

## Files Modified

### `.github/workflows/deploy-azure-azd.yml`

- ✅ Fixed "Validate Aspire manifest" → "Generate Aspire manifest" with `dotnet publish`
- ✅ Replaced `Azure/setup-azd@v1.0.0` with direct installation script (2 locations)
- ✅ Added 5-minute timeout to manifest generation

### `docs/deployment/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (may need update)

- Should document both issues with root causes and solutions
- Includes debugging tips and incident response checklist

## Next Steps

**Manual Actions Required**:

1. Review the changes in `.github/workflows/deploy-azure-azd.yml`
2. Verify both azd installation replacements are correct
3. Commit with message like:

   ```
   fix(ci): Fix 6-hour timeout and azd installation failures
   
   - Replace dotnet run with dotnet publish for Aspire manifest validation
   - Replace Azure/setup-azd action with direct installation script
   - Add timeout safety measure to manifest generation
   
   Fixes:
   - 6-hour timeout issue (run #18583624160)
   - azd network error: ENOTFOUND azdrelease.azureedge.net
   ```

4. Push to main branch
5. Monitor the deployment workflow to verify both fixes work
