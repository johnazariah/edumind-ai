## Overview

EduMind.AI is a sophisticated **multi-agent educational assessment system** built with C# and .NET that provides personalized academic testing and progress tracking across grades 8-12 in five core subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English.

The system supports **two deployment models**:

- **School-Based (B2B)**: White-box SaaS serving 1000+ students per school with dedicated databases
- **Self-Service (B2C)**: Duolingo-style casual signup with freemium pricing for individual learners

The system leverages specialized AI agents to evaluate student performance, identify knowledge gaps, and orchestrate adaptive learning paths using cutting-edge technologies including Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, adaptive testing algorithms, and real-time progress tracking.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Educational Excellence

- **Multi-Subject Assessment**: Comprehensive testing across Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English
- **Adaptive Testing Engine**: IRT-based question selection that adjusts difficulty in real-time
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: Automated scoring with 95%+ accuracy using Azure OpenAI
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Live updates via SignalR for students, teachers, and administrators
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: ML-driven recommendations based on performance analytics

### Flexible Onboarding

- **School-Based (B2B)**: Schools purchase subscriptions, administrators manage students
- **Self-Service (B2C)**: Duolingo-style casual signup with email/Google/Apple OAuth
- **Freemium Model**: Free tier (5 assessments/week) + Premium upgrades
- **Gamification**: Streaks, achievements, experience points, anonymized leaderboards

See [SELF_SERVICE_ONBOARDING.md](docs/SELF_SERVICE_ONBOARDING.md) for self-service architecture.

### Privacy & Security

- **Physical Database Partitioning**: One database per school for absolute data isolation
- **Privacy-Preserving Aggregation**: Minimum 5 students for reports to prevent identification
- **FERPA/GDPR Compliant**: Comprehensive audit logging and right to be forgotten
- **Defense in Depth**: Six layers of security to protect student data
- **Anonymized Reporting**: Course administrators see no personally identifiable information

See [PRIVACY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](docs/PRIVACY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) for complete privacy architecture.

### Performance & Scale

- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports 1000+ concurrent students with <2s response times
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: White-box deployment serving multiple schools concurrently
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Statistical analysis and predictive modeling for intervention identification

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Six User Personas & Interfaces

EduMind.AI implements a comprehensive **role-based access control (RBAC)** system with six distinct user personas:

1. **👨‍🎓 Student** - Take assessments, view progress, receive recommendations
2. **👨‍🏫 Teacher** - Monitor classes, grade assessments, provide feedback
3. **🏫 School Administrator** - School-wide analytics, teacher management, reporting
4. **📚 Course Administrator** - Curriculum design, question banks, content management
5. **💼 Business Administrator** - School onboarding, subscriptions, user provisioning
6. **⚙️ System Administrator** - Infrastructure, monitoring, security, LLM cost tracking

See [RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed role definitions and [ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md) for implementation overview.

### Multi-Agent AI System

1. **Subject Assessment Agents** - Specialized evaluators for each academic subject
2. **Student Progress Orchestrator** - Central coordinator tracking individual student journeys
3. **Adaptive Testing Engine** - Dynamic difficulty adjustment using ML.NET
4. **Performance Analytics Agent** - Statistical analysis and reporting
5. **Curriculum Alignment Agent** - Standards compliance tracking
6. **Recommendation Engine** - Personalized study path generation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start with .NET Aspire (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is using .NET Aspire, which orchestrates all services with one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnazariah/edumind-ai.git
cd edumind-ai
dotnet run --project src/EduMind.AppHost
```

This automatically starts:
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Redis (cache)
- OLLAMA (free local LLM for development/testing)
- Web API
- Dashboard
- Student App

The Aspire Dashboard opens at `https://localhost:17191` with full observability.

### Option 1: Using Dev Container (Also Recommended)

Alternatively, use our pre-configured development container:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Docker Desktop
   - VS Code with Remote-Containers extension

2. **Open in Container:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnazariah/edumind-ai.git
   cd edumind-ai
   code .
   ```

   Then: `F1` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

3. **Everything is pre-installed:**
   - .NET 8.0 SDK, GitHub CLI (`gh`), Azure CLI (`az`)
   - PostgreSQL, Redis, pgAdmin, Redis Commander
   - All VS Code extensions and tools

See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for details.

### LLM Provider Options

EduMind.AI supports multiple LLM providers:

1. **OLLAMA (Default for Development)** - Free, local, privacy-focused
   - Automatically started by Aspire
   - Zero API costs
   - Works offline
   - Models: llama3.2:3b (2GB) or larger

2. **Azure OpenAI** - Production-grade, cloud-based
   - Requires Azure subscription
   - Pay-per-use (~$0.01/evaluation)
   - Best performance and accuracy

3. **Stub LLM** - Mock service for testing
   - No AI, exact string matching only
   - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines

Configure in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "LLM": {
    "Provider": "Ollama"  // or "AzureOpenAI" or "Stub"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Local Installation

If you prefer manual setup without Aspire:

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK or later
- PostgreSQL 16+
- Redis 7+
- OLLAMA (for free local LLM) or Azure OpenAI API access
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnazariah/edumind-ai.git
   cd edumind-ai
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Configure settings**
   - Copy `appsettings.example.json` to `appsettings.json`
   - Update connection strings and API keys

4. **Initialize database**

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project src/AcademicAssessment.Infrastructure
   ```

5. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/AcademicAssessment.Web
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - API: `https://localhost:5001`
   - Dashboard: `https://localhost:5002`
   - Student App: `https://localhost:5003`

## 📊 Performance Metrics
