## Overview

EduMind.AI is a sophisticated **multi-agent educational assessment system** built with C# and .NET that provides personalized academic testing and progress tracking for 1000+ students across grades 8-12 in five core subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English.

The system leverages specialized AI agents to evaluate student performance, identify knowledge gaps, and orchestrate adaptive learning paths using cutting-edge technologies including Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, adaptive testing algorithms, and real-time progress tracking.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-Subject Assessment**: Comprehensive testing across Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English
- **Adaptive Testing Engine**: IRT-based question selection that adjusts difficulty in real-time
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: Automated scoring with 95%+ accuracy using Azure OpenAI
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Live updates via SignalR for students, teachers, and administrators
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: ML-driven recommendations based on performance analytics
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports 1000+ concurrent students with <2s response times
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Statistical analysis and predictive modeling for intervention identification
