## Overview

EduMind.AI is a sophisticated **multi-agent educational assessment system** built with C# and .NET that provides personalized academic testing and progress tracking across grades 8-12 in five core subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English.

The system supports **two deployment models**:

- **School-Based (B2B)**: White-box SaaS serving 1000+ students per school with dedicated databases
- **Self-Service (B2C)**: Duolingo-style casual signup with freemium pricing for individual learners

The system leverages specialized AI agents to evaluate student performance, identify knowledge gaps, and orchestrate adaptive learning paths using cutting-edge technologies including Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, adaptive testing algorithms, and real-time progress tracking.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Educational Excellence

- **Multi-Subject Assessment**: Comprehensive testing across Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English
- **Adaptive Testing Engine**: IRT-based question selection that adjusts difficulty in real-time
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: Automated scoring with 95%+ accuracy using Azure OpenAI
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Live updates via SignalR for students, teachers, and administrators
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: ML-driven recommendations based on performance analytics

### Flexible Onboarding

- **School-Based (B2B)**: Schools purchase subscriptions, administrators manage students
- **Self-Service (B2C)**: Duolingo-style casual signup with email/Google/Apple OAuth
- **Freemium Model**: Free tier (5 assessments/week) + Premium upgrades
- **Gamification**: Streaks, achievements, experience points, anonymized leaderboards
- **COPPA Compliant**: Parental consent for students under 13

See [SELF_SERVICE_ONBOARDING.md](docs/SELF_SERVICE_ONBOARDING.md) for self-service architecture.

### Privacy & Security

- **Physical Database Partitioning**: One database per school for absolute data isolation
- **Privacy-Preserving Aggregation**: Minimum 5 students for reports to prevent identification
- **FERPA/GDPR Compliant**: Comprehensive audit logging and right to be forgotten
- **Defense in Depth**: Six layers of security to protect student data
- **Anonymized Reporting**: Course administrators see no personally identifiable information

See [PRIVACY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](docs/PRIVACY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) for complete privacy architecture.

### Performance & Scale

- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports 1000+ concurrent students with <2s response times
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: White-box deployment serving multiple schools concurrently
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Statistical analysis and predictive modeling for intervention identification

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Six User Personas & Interfaces

EduMind.AI implements a comprehensive **role-based access control (RBAC)** system with six distinct user personas:

1. **👨‍🎓 Student** - Take assessments, view progress, receive recommendations
2. **👨‍🏫 Teacher** - Monitor classes, grade assessments, provide feedback
3. **🏫 School Administrator** - School-wide analytics, teacher management, reporting
4. **📚 Course Administrator** - Curriculum design, question banks, content management
5. **💼 Business Administrator** - School onboarding, subscriptions, user provisioning
6. **⚙️ System Administrator** - Infrastructure, monitoring, security, LLM cost tracking

See [RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed role definitions and [ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md) for implementation overview.

### Multi-Agent AI System

1. **Subject Assessment Agents** - Specialized evaluators for each academic subject
2. **Student Progress Orchestrator** - Central coordinator tracking individual student journeys
3. **Adaptive Testing Engine** - Dynamic difficulty adjustment using ML.NET
4. **Performance Analytics Agent** - Statistical analysis and reporting
5. **Curriculum Alignment Agent** - Standards compliance tracking
6. **Recommendation Engine** - Personalized study path generation

### Technology Stack

- **.NET 8** - Core framework
- **ASP.NET Core** - Web APIs
- **SignalR** - Real-time communication
- **Entity Framework Core** - Data access with PostgreSQL
- **Azure OpenAI GPT-4o** - Primary LLM for content generation
- **ML.NET** - Adaptive algorithms and predictive analytics
- **Redis** - Caching and session management
- **Blazor Server** - Interactive dashboards
- **xUnit** - Testing framework

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Using Dev Container (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is using our pre-configured development container:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Docker Desktop
   - VS Code with Remote-Containers extension

2. **Open in Container:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnazariah/edumind-ai.git
   cd edumind-ai
   code .
   ```

   Then: `F1` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

3. **Everything is pre-installed:**
   - .NET 8.0 SDK, GitHub CLI (`gh`), Azure CLI (`az`)
   - PostgreSQL, Redis, pgAdmin, Redis Commander
   - All VS Code extensions and tools
