## Overview

EduMind.AI is a sophisticated **multi-agent educational assessment system** built with C# and .NET that provides personalized academic testing and progress tracking across grades 8-12 in five core subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English.

The system supports **two deployment models**:

- **School-Based (B2B)**: White-box SaaS serving 1000+ students per school with dedicated databases
- **Self-Service (B2C)**: Duolingo-style casual signup with freemium pricing for individual learners

The system leverages specialized AI agents to evaluate student performance, identify knowledge gaps, and orchestrate adaptive learning paths using cutting-edge technologies including Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, adaptive testing algorithms, and real-time progress tracking.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Educational Excellence

- **Multi-Subject Assessment**: Comprehensive testing across Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English
- **Adaptive Testing Engine**: IRT-based question selection that adjusts difficulty in real-time
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: Automated scoring with 95%+ accuracy using Azure OpenAI
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Live updates via SignalR for students, teachers, and administrators
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: ML-driven recommendations based on performance analytics

### Flexible Onboarding

- **School-Based (B2B)**: Schools purchase subscriptions, administrators manage students
- **Self-Service (B2C)**: Duolingo-style casual signup with email/Google/Apple OAuth
- **Freemium Model**: Free tier (5 assessments/week) + Premium upgrades
- **Gamification**: Streaks, achievements, experience points, anonymized leaderboards

See [SELF_SERVICE_ONBOARDING.md](docs/SELF_SERVICE_ONBOARDING.md) for self-service architecture.

### Privacy & Security

- **Physical Database Partitioning**: One database per school for absolute data isolation
- **Privacy-Preserving Aggregation**: Minimum 5 students for reports to prevent identification
- **FERPA/GDPR Compliant**: Comprehensive audit logging and right to be forgotten
- **Defense in Depth**: Six layers of security to protect student data
- **Anonymized Reporting**: Course administrators see no personally identifiable information

See [PRIVACY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](docs/PRIVACY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) for complete privacy architecture.

### Performance & Scale

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start with .NET Aspire (Recommended)

**The fastest way to run EduMind.AI is with .NET Aspire:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/johnazariah/edumind-ai.git
cd edumind-ai

# Start everything with one command:
dotnet run --project src/EduMind.AppHost
```

**What happens automatically:**

- ✅ PostgreSQL container starts (persistent data)
- ✅ Redis container starts (persistent cache)
- ✅ Ollama container starts (free local AI)
- ✅ Web API builds and runs
- ✅ Dashboard builds and runs
- ✅ Student App builds and runs
- ✅ Service discovery configured
- ✅ Aspire Dashboard opens with telemetry

**Access the applications:**

- 🎛️ **Aspire Dashboard:** <https://localhost:17126> (monitoring & logs)
- 🌐 **Web API:** <http://localhost:5103/swagger>
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard:** <http://localhost:5183>
- 👨‍🎓 **Student App:** <http://localhost:5049>

**Note:** Ports are dynamic - check Aspire Dashboard for actual endpoints.

### Deploy to Azure

**One command deploys the entire stack to Azure:**

```bash
# Install Azure Developer CLI
curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash

# Deploy (prompts for subscription, environment name, location)
azd up
```

**What happens automatically:**

- ✅ Creates Azure Container Apps Environment
- ✅ Provisions Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server (Entra ID auth)
- ✅ Provisions Azure Cache for Redis (Entra ID auth)
- ✅ Builds and pushes container images to Azure Container Registry
- ✅ Deploys all services to Azure Container Apps
- ✅ Configures service discovery and bindings
- ✅ Sets up managed identity authentication

**Same code runs locally (containers) and remotely (Azure managed services)!**

### Option 1: Using Dev Container

Use our pre-configured development container (all tools pre-installed):

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Docker Desktop
   - VS Code with Remote-Containers extension

2. **Open in Container:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnazariah/edumind-ai.git
   cd edumind-ai
   code .
   ```

   Then: `F1` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

3. **Everything is pre-installed:**
   - .NET 9 SDK, Aspire workload, Azure CLI, GitHub CLI
   - PostgreSQL, Redis, pgAdmin, Redis Commander
   - All VS Code extensions and tools

4. **Start the stack:**

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/EduMind.AppHost
   ```

See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for details.

### LLM Provider Options

EduMind.AI supports multiple LLM providers:

1. **OLLAMA (Default for Local Development)** - Free, local, privacy-focused
   - Automatically started by Aspire AppHost
   - Zero API costs
   - Works offline
   - Models: llama3.2:3b (2GB) or larger
   - Container managed with persistent storage

2. **Azure OpenAI (Production)** - Cloud-based, production-grade
   - Requires Azure subscription
   - Pay-per-use (~$0.01/evaluation)
   - Best performance and accuracy
   - Automatically used in Azure deployments

3. **Stub LLM (Testing)** - Mock service for CI/CD
   - No AI, exact string matching only
   - Perfect for automated testing

Configure in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "LLM": {
    "Provider": "Ollama"  // or "AzureOpenAI" or "Stub"
  }
}
```

**Note:** Azure deployments automatically skip Ollama and expect Azure OpenAI configuration via environment variables or Key Vault.

### Option 2: Manual Local Setup (Without Aspire)

If you prefer manual setup without Aspire orchestration:

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK or later
- PostgreSQL 16+
- Redis 7+
- OLLAMA (for free local LLM) or Azure OpenAI API access
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension

### Installation

   git clone https://github.com/johnazariah/edumind-ai.git
   cd edumind-ai
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Configure settings**
   - Copy `appsettings.example.json` to `appsettings.json`
   - Update connection strings and API keys

4. **Initialize database**

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project src/AcademicAssessment.Infrastructure
   ```

5. **Run the application**
