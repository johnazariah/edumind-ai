# TODO-003: Build Assessment Results Page

**Priority:** P1 - High  
**Area:** Frontend / Blazor  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours)  
**Status:** Not Started

## Description

Create a comprehensive results page that displays assessment outcomes, performance metrics, and personalized recommendations after a student completes an assessment.

## Context

After submitting an assessment, students need immediate feedback on their performance. The results page should provide:

- Overall score and percentage
- Subject-wise performance breakdown
- Time efficiency metrics
- Question-level results (correct/incorrect/skipped)
- Strong and weak area identification
- Personalized recommendations for improvement
- Navigation to detailed answer review

Currently, there's a TODO comment in `AssessmentResults.razor.cs` (line 107) for implementing the review answers feature.

## Technical Requirements

### API Endpoint Needed

```csharp
GET /api/v1.0/Assessment/results/{sessionId}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "sessionId": "guid",
  "assessmentTitle": "Introduction to Algebra",
  "completedAt": "2025-10-25T15:00:00Z",
  "totalTimeSpent": 1800,
  "estimatedDuration": 2400,
  "overallScore": {
    "points": 85,
    "maxPoints": 100,
    "percentage": 85.0
  },
  "subjectBreakdown": [
    {
      "subject": "Algebra",
      "correct": 12,
      "total": 15,
      "percentage": 80.0,
      "masteryLevel": "Developing"
    },
    {
      "subject": "Geometry",
      "correct": 8,
      "total": 10,
      "percentage": 80.0,
      "masteryLevel": "Proficient"
    }
  ],
  "questionResults": [
    {
      "questionId": "guid",
      "questionNumber": 1,
      "subject": "Algebra",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "correct": true,
      "points": 5,
      "maxPoints": 5,
      "timeSpent": 120
    }
  ],
  "strongAreas": ["Linear Equations", "Graphing"],
  "weakAreas": ["Quadratic Equations", "Word Problems"],
  "recommendations": [
    "Review quadratic formula and practice word problems",
    "Consider taking the advanced algebra assessment next"
  ],
  "aiFeedback": "Great work on linear equations! Focus on improving..."
}
```

### UI Components

**1. Results Header**

- Assessment title
- Completion timestamp
- Overall score (large, prominent display)
- Grade badge (A, B, C, etc.)

**2. Performance Summary Card**

- Score percentage with progress circle
- Points breakdown (earned / total)
- Time efficiency indicator (time spent vs estimated)
- Performance badge (Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement)

**3. Subject Breakdown Section**

- Chart.js or similar visualization
- Bar chart showing performance by subject
- Table with subject, correct/total, percentage, mastery level
- Color coding: green (proficient), yellow (developing), red (beginning)

**4. Question Results Grid**

- Question number, subject, difficulty
- Correct/incorrect indicator (✓ or ✗)
- Points earned
- Time spent per question
- Sortable and filterable

**5. Insights Section**

- "Your Strengths" list (strong areas)
- "Areas for Improvement" list (weak areas)
- AI-generated personalized feedback
- Study recommendations

**6. Action Buttons**

- "Review Answers" - Navigate to detailed review page
- "Retake Assessment" - Start new attempt
- "Return to Dashboard" - Go back to assessment list
- "Share Results" - Export or print results

## Implementation Notes

1. **Chart Library Selection:** Consider Chart.js, Plotly, or Recharts for visualizations
2. **Performance:** Lazy load chart library to reduce initial bundle size
3. **Caching:** Cache results on client side to avoid re-fetching
4. **Print Support:** Add CSS media queries for print-friendly layout
5. **Export:** Consider adding PDF export functionality
6. **Animations:** Add subtle animations for score reveal
7. **Comparison:** Consider showing historical comparison if student has multiple attempts

## UI/UX Considerations

- Use color coding consistently (green = good, red = needs work)
- Make score prominent and celebratory for good performance
- Be encouraging even for lower scores
- Provide actionable next steps, not just numbers
- Ensure mobile users can see all data without excessive scrolling
- Consider progressive disclosure for detailed data

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**

- Mock API response data
- Test component rendering with various score ranges
- Test navigation button handlers
- Verify calculations (percentages, mastery levels)

**Integration Tests:**

- Submit assessment and verify results load
- Test results API endpoint with real data
- Verify chart rendering with different data sets

**Manual Testing:**

- Complete assessment with various scores
- Verify all sections display correctly
- Test on mobile devices
- Test print functionality
- Verify accessibility with screen reader
- Test "Review Answers" navigation
- Test "Retake" and "Dashboard" buttons
