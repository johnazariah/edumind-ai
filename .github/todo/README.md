## Using TODOs with GitHub Copilot

Each TODO is written to provide sufficient context for a GitHub Copilot coding agent to implement the feature autonomously:

1. **Read the TODO file completely**
2. **Review referenced files** for current implementation
3. **Follow the technical requirements** precisely
4. **Implement acceptance criteria** one by one
5. **Add tests** as specified in testing strategy
6. **Update documentation** as needed
7. **Submit PR** with TODO number in title

Example workflow:

```bash
# Agent reads TODO
cat .github/todo/p1-high/001-implement-save-api-endpoint.md

# Agent analyzes current code
cat src/AcademicAssessment.Web/Controllers/AssessmentController.cs

# Agent implements feature following TODO specs
# Agent writes tests
# Agent updates docs
# Agent submits PR: "feat: Implement Save API Endpoint (TODO-001)"
```

## Roadmap Alignment

TODOs are aligned with the project roadmap:

**Week 1 (Complete):** Orchestrator logic ✅
**Week 2 (75% complete):** Student UI - Assessment workflow
**Week 3 (Not started):** Enhanced features & polish
**Week 4 (Not started):** Integration testing
**Week 5-6 (Not started):** Azure deployment
