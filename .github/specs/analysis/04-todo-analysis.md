# Analysis Story: TODO Items and Next Steps

## Objective

Create a comprehensive `todo.md` file that clearly describes all pending work, prioritized and organized by area, with clear acceptance criteria for each item.

## Context

The EduMind.AI project has various incomplete features, known issues, technical debt, and planned enhancements scattered across multiple locations:

- `docs/planning/NEXT_STEPS.md`
- `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`
- TODO comments in code
- Known issues in deployment docs
- Open GitHub issues (if any)
- Commit messages with "WIP" or "TODO"

## Task Instructions

### 1. Review Planning Documents

Analyze:

- `docs/planning/NEXT_STEPS.md` - Planned next steps
- `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` - Overall roadmap
- `docs/planning/sprints/**/*.md` - Sprint retrospectives
- `docs/planning/TASK_JOURNAL.md` - Task tracking

### 2. Extract Known Issues from Deployment Docs

Review deployment documentation for unresolved issues:

- `docs/deployment/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `docs/deployment/**/*.md` - Any "Known Issues" sections
- Recent deployment failure notes

Specific known issues to document:

- Blazor Server SignalR connectivity issues (from recent session)
- Blazor error UI appearing despite functionality working
- Template variable substitution in azd (may still be relevant)

### 3. Search Codebase for TODO Comments

```bash
# Find all TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" src/ --include="*.cs" --include="*.razor" -n > /tmp/code-todos.txt

# Find WIP commits
git log --all --grep="WIP" --oneline

# Find commented-out code that may indicate pending work
grep -r "// Commented out\|// Disabled" src/ --include="*.cs" -B2 -A2
```

### 4. Analyze Incomplete Features

Review the most recent work:

- Assessment session interactive features (may need HTML link conversion like detail page)
- Results page functionality
- Dashboard analytics features
- Multi-agent orchestration implementation status
- AI feedback generation

Check component implementations:

- `src/AcademicAssessment.StudentApp/Components/Pages/AssessmentSession.razor`
- `src/AcademicAssessment.StudentApp/Components/Pages/AssessmentResults.razor`
- `src/AcademicAssessment.Dashboard/Components/`

### 5. Review Test Coverage Gaps

```bash
# Check for test files and coverage
find tests/ -name "*.cs" | wc -l
cat coverage-output.txt  # If exists
```

Identify:

- Untested components
- Missing integration tests
- E2E test gaps
- Performance test needs

### 6. Extract Infrastructure TODOs

Review infrastructure code for:

- Missing Azure resources
- Incomplete deployment automation
- Configuration management gaps
- Monitoring/alerting setup needs

### 7. Identify Technical Debt

Look for patterns indicating technical debt:

- Workarounds (grep for "workaround")
- Quick fixes marked for refactoring
- Duplicated code
- Obsolete patterns
- Performance issues noted in commits

### 8. Review Security and Compliance TODOs

Check:

- Authentication completeness
- Authorization coverage
- Data encryption status
- Privacy compliance items
- Security scanning setup

### 9. Document Documentation Needs

Identify missing or incomplete documentation:

- API documentation gaps
- User guides
- Admin guides
- Deployment runbooks
- Troubleshooting guides

### 10. Extract CI/CD Improvements

Review workflow files:

- `.github/workflows/**/*.yml`
- Missing automation
- Manual steps that should be automated
- Failed or disabled checks

## Expected Output Structure

Create a series of files in `.github/todo/{PRIORITY}/{ITEM_NAME}.md` for these sections. For each of these items, put sufficient context and requisite prompts for a github copilot agent to analyze and complete the work - a copilot agent with a clean context should be able to take a `todo` item and implement it.

### Critical Priority (P0) - Must Do Soon

Items blocking key functionality or causing significant issues.

For each item:

```markdown
#### TODO-001: [Clear Title]
**Priority:** P0
**Area:** [Frontend/Backend/Infrastructure/Testing/Documentation]
**Description:** Clear description of what needs to be done and why
**Context:** Background information, related issues, or history
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Specific, testable criterion 1
- [ ] Specific, testable criterion 2
**Estimated Effort:** [Small/Medium/Large]
**Dependencies:** Related TODO items or external dependencies
**References:** Commits, files, or docs related to this item
```

Categories for P0:

- Fix Blazor Server SignalR / Interactive Components
- Complete Assessment Session Workflow
- Fix Critical Performance Issues
- Security Vulnerabilities
- Data Integrity Issues

### High Priority (P1) - Should Do Next

Important features or improvements that should be tackled soon.

Categories for P1:

- Complete Student Assessment Features
- Dashboard Analytics Implementation
- Multi-Agent Orchestration Completion
- Test Coverage Improvements
- CI/CD Automation Gaps
- Production Deployment Readiness

### Medium Priority (P2) - Nice to Have

Enhancements and improvements that add value but aren't urgent.

Categories for P2:

- UI/UX Enhancements
- Performance Optimizations
- Code Refactoring
- Documentation Improvements
- Additional Test Coverage
- Developer Experience Improvements

### Low Priority (P3) - Future Enhancements

Long-term improvements and nice-to-have features.

Categories for P3:

- Advanced Features
- Experimental Integrations
- Research Spikes
- Technical Debt Cleanup
- Tooling Enhancements

### Technical Debt

Specific technical debt items that should be addressed:

- Code that needs refactoring
- Workarounds that should be replaced with proper solutions
- Deprecated dependencies
- Performance bottlenecks
- Architectural inconsistencies

### Research/Spikes Needed

Areas where investigation is needed before work can proceed:

- Technology evaluation
- Architecture decisions pending research
- Performance profiling needs
- Security audits

### Blocked Items

Work that is blocked and waiting on something:

- What it's blocked on
- Expected resolution timeline
- Mitigation strategies

### Completed Recently (For Context)

Recently completed items from last week to provide context:

- HttpClient configuration fix (performance improvement)
- HTML navigation workaround for Blazor issues
- UI test framework setup
- [Extract from recent commits]

## Success Criteria

- All known TODOs are captured
- Items are properly prioritized
- Each item has clear acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort is provided
- Dependencies are identified
- Items are actionable and specific
- Organized logically by priority and area
- 50-100 distinct TODO items documented
- Balance between detail and brevity

## Notes

- Be realistic about priorities
- Include both feature work and technical debt
- Consider maintainability, not just new features
- Flag items that might be controversial or require discussion
- Note items that could be parallelized
- Identify quick wins separately
- Consider both short-term and long-term needs
- Include infrastructure and DevOps tasks
- Don't forget documentation and testing items

## Example TODO Format

```markdown
#### TODO-042: Convert All Blazor @onclick Events to HTML Navigation

**Priority:** P1
**Area:** Frontend
**Description:** Following the successful fix for the "Start Assessment" button, convert all remaining Blazor @onclick navigation events in the Student App to HTML anchor links. This bypasses the Blazor Server SignalR connectivity issues that prevent interactive components from functioning properly.

**Context:** Recent commit c45c0ec fixed two critical navigation buttons by converting them from Blazor @onclick to HTML links. Testing showed the Blazor error UI appears due to SignalR connection issues, but pages load and display data correctly. This is a temporary workaround until either the SignalR issues are resolved or we migrate to React.

**Affected Components:**
- AssessmentSession.razor (Previous/Next buttons, Submit button)
- AssessmentResults.razor (Review and Retake buttons)
- Home.razor (remaining navigation)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All navigation buttons in Student App use HTML links instead of @onclick
- [ ] Navigation works correctly in browser without JavaScript errors
- [ ] Page transitions are smooth and maintain expected behavior
- [ ] Test all user workflows end-to-end
- [ ] Update any component code that depends on @onclick events

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (2-4 hours)

**Dependencies:** None - can be done immediately

**References:** 
- Commit c45c0ec (WIP: Fix Student App HTTP client and navigation issues)
- src/AcademicAssessment.StudentApp/Components/Pages/AssessmentDetail.razor
- docs/deployment/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (documents the issue)

**Alternative:** Consider React migration (TODO-150) as longer-term solution
```
