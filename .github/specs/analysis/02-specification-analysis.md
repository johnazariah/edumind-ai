# Analysis Story: System Specification

## Objective

Create a comprehensive `specification.md` that clearly and completely describes the EduMind.AI system we have built, including architecture, features, data models, and integration points.

## Context

EduMind.AI is an academic assessment platform with AI-powered adaptive testing. The system has been developed over multiple weeks with various components, but there's no single comprehensive specification document. Information is scattered across:

- Architecture documents in `docs/architecture/`
- Planning documents in `docs/planning/`
- Code implementations
- Deployment documentation

## Task Instructions

### 1. Review Architecture Documentation

Analyze these key documents:

- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_DIAGRAM.md`
- `docs/architecture/SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/architecture/RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/architecture/PRIVACY_AND_SECURITY.md`
- `docs/architecture/OBSERVABILITY_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/architecture/CONTENT_METADATA_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/architecture/A2A_AGENT_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`

### 2. Analyze Solution Structure

Review the actual implementation:

**Core Projects:**

```bash
ls -la src/AcademicAssessment.Core/
ls -la src/AcademicAssessment.Infrastructure/
ls -la src/AcademicAssessment.Analytics/
ls -la src/AcademicAssessment.Agents/
ls -la src/AcademicAssessment.Orchestration/
```

**Application Projects:**

```bash
ls -la src/AcademicAssessment.Web/
ls -la src/AcademicAssessment.StudentApp/
ls -la src/AcademicAssessment.Dashboard/
```

**Aspire Orchestration:**

```bash
ls -la src/EduMind.AppHost/
ls -la src/EduMind.ServiceDefaults/
```

### 3. Extract Data Models

Analyze domain models:

- `src/AcademicAssessment.Core/Models/` - Domain entities
- `src/AcademicAssessment.Core/Models/Dtos/` - Data transfer objects
- `src/AcademicAssessment.Core/Enums/` - Enumerations
- Database schema from `scripts/seed-demo-data*.sql`

### 4. Document API Endpoints

Review controllers:

- `src/AcademicAssessment.Web/Controllers/*.cs`
- API versioning strategy (observed: v1.0)
- Request/response formats
- Authentication/authorization

### 5. Analyze Frontend Applications

Review Blazor components:

- **Student App:** `src/AcademicAssessment.StudentApp/Components/`
  - Assessment taking workflow
  - Result visualization
  - Progress tracking
- **Dashboard:** `src/AcademicAssessment.Dashboard/Components/`
  - Administrative functions
  - Analytics views

### 6. Review AI/Agent Integration

Analyze:

- `src/AcademicAssessment.Agents/` - Agent implementations
- `src/AcademicAssessment.Orchestration/` - Multi-agent orchestration
- Semantic Kernel integration
- Ollama integration for local LLM

### 7. Extract Infrastructure Components

Review Bicep templates:

- `infra/main.bicep` - Azure resources
- `src/infra/*.bicep` - Aspire-generated infrastructure
- Connection strings and service discovery patterns

### 8. Analyze Configuration

Review configuration files:

- `appsettings.json` across all projects
- Environment-specific settings
- Feature flags
- Logging configuration

### 9. Review Planning Documents

Extract requirements from:

- `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/planning/PR_WEEK2_DESCRIPTION.md`
- Sprint documentation in `docs/planning/sprints/`
- `docs/planning/NEXT_STEPS.md`

## Expected Output Structure

## Notes

- Focus on WHAT is built, not HOW to build it
- Include actual code snippets where illustrative
- Reference existing diagrams rather than recreating
- Note areas where implementation differs from original plans
- Highlight innovative or unique aspects
- Be precise about versions, frameworks, and dependencies
