# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - EduMind.AI

## Introduction

This directory contains **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** documenting significant architectural and technical decisions made during the EduMind.AI project development from October 2025 onwards.

### What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- **Document decisions**: Create institutional memory
- **Understand context**: Why certain choices were made
- **Learn from history**: Avoid repeating past mistakes
- **Onboard new team members**: Understand the system's evolution
- **Review trade-offs**: Revisit decisions when circumstances change

### ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted | ‚ö†Ô∏è Superseded | üîÑ Proposed | ‚ùå Rejected
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The problem or situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Consequences**: Positive/negative impacts and trade-offs
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options and why they were rejected
- **Related Decisions**: Links to other ADRs
- **References**: Code, commits, documentation

## Key Decision Themes

### Privacy-First Architecture

Multiple ADRs emphasize student data privacy:

- Physical database isolation per school (ADR-005, ADR-021)
- No client-side assessment data exposure (ADR-002)
- FERPA/GDPR compliance by design

### Cloud-Native Design

Decisions optimized for Azure deployment:

- Container Apps for auto-scaling (ADR-020)
- Managed services over self-hosted (ADR-021, ADR-006)
- OpenTelemetry for observability (ADR-080)
- Runtime configuration over deployment-time (ADR-022)

### Developer Experience

Choices prioritizing productivity:

- Aspire for local development (ADR-007)
- Ollama for cost-free LLM testing (ADR-004)
- Reusable CI/CD workflows (ADR-040)
- Strong typing with C# 13 (ADR-001, ADR-028)

### Pragmatic Over Perfect

Real-world decisions over theoretical purity:

- Client-secret auth when OIDC blocked (ADR-033)
- HTML links when SignalR unreliable (ADR-063)
- Azure Database when containerized PostgreSQL failed (ADR-021)
- Runtime FQDN detection when templates failed (ADR-022)

## Superseded Decisions

Decisions that were later changed:

- **ADR-001**: Partially superseded by ADR-028 (upgraded .NET 8 ‚Üí .NET 9)
- **Containerized PostgreSQL**: Superseded by ADR-021 (migrated to managed PostgreSQL)
- **OIDC Authentication**: Superseded by ADR-033 (switched to client-secret)
- **Template Variable Injection**: Superseded by ADR-022 (runtime detection)

## Deferred Decisions

Areas where decisions are pending:

- **Multi-Tenant Strategy**: Currently one database per school, may need shared schema for B2C
- **LLM Provider Selection**: Currently Azure OpenAI for production, may add Anthropic/others
- **Frontend Framework**: Currently Blazor Server, may evaluate Blazor WebAssembly for offline support
- **Distributed Agents**: Currently in-process agents, may move to microservices at scale

## Decision-Making Process

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:

- Are architecturally significant (affect structure, dependencies, performance)
- Are difficult to reverse (database choice, authentication approach)
- Have long-term consequences (2+ years)
- Were controversial or had multiple viable alternatives
- Required significant research or debate

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create ADRs for:

- Trivial implementation details (variable naming, file organization)
- Technology evaluations that didn't lead to decisions
- Decisions mandated by external factors (client requirements)
- Temporary workarounds (unless architecturally interesting like ADR-063)

## Contributing to ADRs

### Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template (see below)
2. Assign next available number in appropriate category
3. Fill in all sections with clear, concise content
4. Get review from 2+ team members
5. Merge to main branch

### Updating an Existing ADR

- **Never modify past decisions**: ADRs are historical records
- **To change a decision**: Create new ADR that supersedes the old one
- **To add context**: Add "See also" reference or create supplementary ADR
