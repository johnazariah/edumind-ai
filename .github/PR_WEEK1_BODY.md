- **Optional Steps**: Graceful handling of non-critical failures
- **Testing**: 378/381 tests passing (99.2%)
- **Commits**: 90733fb, 14db803

### ✅ Day 4: State Persistence
- **Database Entities**: 4 entities (WorkflowExecution, CircuitBreaker, RoutingDecision, RoutingStatistics)
- **Repository Layer**: Interfaces and EF Core implementations
- **OrchestrationStateService**: Full state management and recovery

- ✅ `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` - Week 1 status updated
- ✅ Architecture decisions documented
- ✅ Testing results and logs included

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Implemented
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for failing agents
- **Priority Queue**: Task prioritization and ordering
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer
- **Singleton with Scoped Access**: Metrics service architecture
- **Hub-Spoke**: SignalR group-based messaging

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Scoped Orchestrator Access**: Singleton metrics service creates scopes to access scoped orchestrator
2. **Group-Based SignalR**: "monitoring" group pattern for scalable broadcasting
3. **Health Calculation**: Multi-factor algorithm (circuit breakers + success rate)
4. **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive retry delays (1s → 2s → 4s)

## 🚀 What's Next (Week 2)

After this PR is merged:
1. **Student Assessment UI**: Build student-facing Blazor interface
2. **Question Delivery**: Implement assessment delivery system
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time student progress monitoring
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance
5. **Mobile Support**: Responsive design for all devices
