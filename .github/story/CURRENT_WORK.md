# Current Work Status

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Active Story:** p1-018-aspire-deployment-parity-local-remote

---

## Current Objective

Achieve deployment parity between local and remote environments using Aspire's unified service discovery.

**Goal:** Same code, same configuration, works identically locally (via Aspire orchestration) and remotely (via Azure Container Apps).

---

## Why This Story?

### The Problem

**Current State:**
- Local: Hardcoded `localhost:5432` connections
- Azure: Different hostnames, manual configuration
- Result: "Works on my machine" syndrome

**Impact:**
- Deployment failures due to configuration drift
- Cannot reproduce production issues locally
- Maintaining two parallel configuration systems

### The Solution

**Aspire Unified Service Discovery:**
- Single `Program.cs` in AppHost defines service topology
- Aspire manages containers locally, provisions Azure resources remotely
- Services discover dependencies automatically (no hardcoded URLs)
- Same integration tests work in both environments

---

## Story Details

**Priority:** P1 (Production Quality)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks (39 hours)  
**Tasks:** 12 tasks across 5 phases

### Phases

1. **Core Aspire Integration (7h)** - Convert AppHost to use Aspire resource APIs
2. **Service Communication (6h)** - Update services to use service discovery
3. **Azure Infrastructure (9h)** - Update Bicep templates for Aspire deployment
4. **Testing & Documentation (11h)** - Update tests and docs
5. **Production Deployment (6h)** - Deploy and validate in Azure

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Start Task 1:** Update AppHost to use `AddPostgres()`, `AddRedis()`
2. **Test locally:** Verify Aspire starts containers automatically
3. **Update Web API:** Remove hardcoded connection strings

### This Week

- Complete Phase 1 & 2 (Core integration + Service communication)
- Local testing & validation
- Begin Bicep template updates

### Next Week

- Azure deployment and validation
- Documentation updates
- Integration test migration

## Environment Status

### Local Development

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Docker running (PostgreSQL + Redis containers active)
- ✅ .NET 9.0 SDK installed
- ✅ Solution builds successfully (44 warnings - expected)

**Services:**
- ⏳ Not running (will start via Aspire after Task 1)
- ⏳ Database migrations pending
- ⏳ Service discovery not yet configured

### Azure Deployment

- ⏳ Pending Story 018 completion
- ⏳ Bicep templates need Aspire updates
- ⏳ Service bindings not yet configured

---

## Quick Commands

### Local Development (After Task 1)

```bash
# Start entire stack via Aspire
dotnet run --project src/EduMind.AppHost

# Access Aspire Dashboard
# Usually opens automatically at https://localhost:15000
```

### Build & Test

```bash
# Build
dotnet build EduMind.AI.sln --configuration Debug

# Run integration tests
dotnet test tests/AcademicAssessment.Tests.Integration

# Run all tests
dotnet test
```

### Azure Deployment (After Task 6-7)

```bash
# Deploy to Azure
azd deploy

# View logs
az containerapp logs show --name webapi --resource-group rg-<env>
```

## Story Dependencies

**This story (018) blocks:**
- Story 007: Multi-Tenant Physical Isolation (needs unified connection management)
- Story 011: Monitoring & Alerting (uses Aspire's telemetry)

**Related stories:**
- Story 005: Optimize Ollama LLM Performance (local AI configuration)
- Story 012: API Rate Limiting (service-to-service patterns)

---

## Notes

- Aspire is Microsoft's recommended pattern for cloud-native .NET
- Service discovery eliminates hardcoded URLs and environment-specific configs
- This is foundational for production readiness
- Consider this story **high priority** to unblock other production work
