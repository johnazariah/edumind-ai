### 3.2 Key Architectural Decisions

**ADR 1: Blazor Hybrid over MAUI XAML**
- **Decision:** Use BlazorWebView instead of XAML
- **Rationale:** Maximize code reuse from existing Blazor web app
- **Trade-off:** Slightly larger app size, but worth it for 75-85% reuse

**ADR 2: SQLite for Offline Storage**
- **Decision:** Use SQLite with SQLCipher encryption
- **Rationale:** Standard, performant, cross-platform
- **Alternative:** Realm (more features but heavier)

**ADR 3: Firebase Cloud Messaging for Push**
- **Decision:** FCM for Android, APNS for iOS
- **Rationale:** Industry standard, free tier sufficient
- **Alternative:** Azure Notification Hubs (overkill for needs)

**ADR 4: Shared Core Project**
- **Decision:** Move business logic to AcademicAssessment.Core
- **Rationale:** Share between Web, Mobile, and API
- **Benefit:** Single source of truth, easier maintenance
