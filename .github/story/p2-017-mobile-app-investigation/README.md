## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: GO

**Proceed with .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid implementation**

**Phased Approach:**
1. **Phase 1:** Android MVP (14-16 weeks, $80K-110K) ‚Üí START HERE
2. **Phase 2:** Enhanced features (6-8 weeks, $50K-70K) ‚Üí After MVP proven
3. **Phase 3:** iOS version (4-6 weeks, $40K-60K) ‚Üí Expand market

**Justification:**
- ‚úÖ Strategic imperative (compete with Duolingo, Khan Academy)
- ‚úÖ Technical feasibility confirmed
- ‚úÖ High code reuse (75-85%)
- ‚úÖ Positive ROI (73%)
- ‚úÖ Team has expertise (C#, Blazor)

### Alternative: PWA Stopgap

**If timeline/budget critical:**
- Build PWA first (2-3 weeks, $20K-30K)
- Get basic mobile experience quickly
- Build MAUI app in parallel
- Deprecate PWA when native ready

**Trade-off:** Less competitive, no app store, limited features

### NOT Recommended: React Native

**Why not:**
- 0% code reuse (must rewrite UI)
- 50% higher cost ($190K-260K)
- Team doesn't have React Native expertise
- Separate codebase to maintain
