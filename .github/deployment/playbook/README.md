## üí° Tips for Using Playbooks

### Copy-Paste Commands

All commands in playbooks are designed to be copy-paste friendly. Replace placeholders:

- `<your-subscription-id>` - Your Azure subscription ID
- `<container-id>` - Docker container ID
- `<app-insights-name>` - Your Application Insights resource name
- `dev` - Environment name (dev, staging, prod)

### Command Explanations

Commands include inline comments explaining what they do:

```bash
# This comment explains what the command does
az containerapp show --name ca-webapi-dev --resource-group rg-dev

# Multi-line commands use backslashes
az containerapp logs show \
  --name ca-webapi-dev \
  --resource-group rg-dev \
  --tail 100
```

### Verification Steps

Each major step includes a verification command to confirm success. Look for:

- **Expected output:** What you should see
- **If not:** Troubleshooting steps

### Time Estimates

- **Beginner:** No prior experience with the technology
- **Intermediate:** Familiar with Azure/Docker/CLI basics
- **Advanced:** Deep expertise, comfortable with KQL and infrastructure

Time estimates assume:

- Stable internet connection
- All prerequisites met
- No unexpected errors

Add 50% buffer time if you're learning.
