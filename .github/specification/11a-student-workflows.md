## Overview

Students use EduMind.AI to take assessments, review their performance, track progress over time, and receive personalized learning recommendations. The platform provides an intuitive, distraction-free assessment experience with real-time feedback and progress visualization.

**Key Student Capabilities:**

- Browse and start available assessments
- Complete assessments with various question types (MCQ, FRQ, essay, coding, etc.)
- Auto-save progress to prevent data loss
- Track time spent on questions
- Review results with detailed explanations
- View performance analytics and trends
- Identify weak areas needing improvement
- Receive personalized topic recommendations
- Compare performance with peers (privacy-protected)

## 1. Student Registration and Onboarding

### Workflow Steps

1. **Navigate to Student Portal**
   - Access URL: `https://edumind-student.azurecontainerapps.io` (production) or `http://localhost:5001` (development)

3. **Profile Creation**
   - System creates `Student` entity in database
   - Assigns student to school and default class
   - Generates unique `StudentId` (GUID)
   - Sets initial `AbilityEstimate` to 0.0 (neutral starting point)

4. **Initial Assessment (Optional)**
   - Some schools require diagnostic assessment
   - Establishes baseline ability estimates across subjects
   - Typically 10-15 questions per subject
   - Used to initialize adaptive assessment algorithm

5. **Dashboard Access**

## 7. Adaptive Learning Path

### Workflow Steps

1. **Adaptive Assessment Selection**
   - System recommends next assessment based on:
     - Current ability estimates (IRT)
     - Recent performance trends
     - Learning objectives not yet mastered
     - Teacher priorities

2. **Question Selection Algorithm**
   - For adaptive assessments:
     - First question: Medium difficulty (Î¸ = 0.0)
     - Subsequent questions: Difficulty adjusted based on previous responses
     - Correct answer â†’ Increase difficulty (higher Î¸)
     - Incorrect answer â†’ Decrease difficulty (lower Î¸)
     - Target: Questions at student's ability level (50% chance of correct answer)

3. **Ability Estimate Updates**
   - After each assessment:
     - Recalculate ability estimate using IRT
     - Î¸ (theta) = student ability on -3 to +3 scale
     - Formula: Maximum likelihood estimation based on response pattern
   - Updated ability estimates used for next assessment

4. **Learning Path Visualization**
   - Display learning path with milestones:
     - Current position: "Algebra - Proficient"
     - Next milestone: "Algebra - Advanced"
     - Recommended steps:
       1. Complete practice assessment: "Quadratic Equations Review"
       2. Master learning objective: "Factor complex polynomials"
       3. Complete summative assessment: "Algebra II Mastery Test"

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Student Runs Out of Time

**Problem:** Time limit expires before student completes assessment

**System Behavior:**

1. Display warning at 5 minutes remaining
2. Auto-submit when time expires
3. Save all answered questions
4. Score completed questions only
5. Mark unanswered questions as "Not Attempted"
6. Display message: "Time expired. Your assessment has been automatically submitted."

---

### Scenario 2: Student Loses Internet Connection

**Problem:** Network disconnected during assessment

**System Behavior:**

1. Display "Connection lost" warning banner
2. Continue allowing student to answer questions (offline mode)
3. Store responses in browser local storage
4. Attempt to reconnect every 10 seconds
5. When reconnected, sync all responses to server
6. Display "Connection restored. Your answers have been saved."

---

### Scenario 3: Student Accidentally Closes Browser

**Problem:** Browser closed with assessment in progress

**System Behavior:**

1. Last auto-save stored in Redis cache (TTL: 4 hours)
2. Student returns and logs in again
3. Dashboard displays "Resume Assessment" button for incomplete session
4. Click "Resume" â†’ Load session from cache
5. Continue from last saved question
6. All previous answers preserved

---

### Scenario 4: Student Wants to Review Before Submission

**Problem:** Student unsure about some answers

**System Behavior:**

1. Student flags questions for review (yellow badge in palette)
2. Before submission, click "Review Flagged Questions"
3. Navigate through only flagged questions
4. Update answers as needed
5. Click "Submit" when satisfied
6. Confirmation dialog shows flagged count

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Assessment session not found"

**Cause:** Session expired (TTL exceeded 4 hours)

**Solution:**

1. Start new assessment session
2. Previous responses not recovered
3. Contact teacher if assessment was critical

---

### Issue: Auto-save failing repeatedly

**Cause:** Network issues or server problems

**Solution:**

1. Check internet connection
2. Responses stored locally in browser
3. Retry save when connection restored
4. If persistent, contact support

---

### Issue: Unable to submit essay question

**Cause:** Character limit exceeded or formatting issues

**Solution:**

1. Check character count (max: 5000 characters)
2. Remove excessive formatting
3. Simplify answer to fit within limit
4. Use plain text if rich formatting causing issues

---

### Issue: Timer not displaying correctly

**Cause:** Browser timezone mismatch or JavaScript error

**Solution:**

1. Refresh page (auto-save preserves progress)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Disable browser extensions that might interfere
4. Use different browser if issue persists
